    <!-- Final thoughts -->
    <!-- It was quite a challenge if you ask me; but it was still fun. I was able to learn a few things while fixing up the code. The most prominant one was the difference between (for of) vs (for in) located in the coder.js thanks to Ajaeb's help. It seems that I need to study that so I can use the respective words properly.
    Another thing I need to work on is paying attention. I was this close to submitting the "rps.js" while assuming it was bug free. Thanks to Joan, turns out it was a logic problem. I should have read more carefully. The final verdict? I think this is a good way to learn about stuff I don't know. -->
